# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mikefsdev!

I am a full stack developer who has a strong passion towards building innovative web applications and blockchain technologies. I plan on fully embracing the web3 movement through my work and use my skills to help others grow their own ideas. I've had the opportunity to already work with many different projects that I am very proud of and I wish to expand my portfolio throughout my career.

I have all the necessary skills and disciplines to develop projects from the ground up. I am able to take mere ideas and proposals, and turn them into full fledged programs, sites, technology, and/or code.

- React.js, JavaScript, Angular.js, TypeScript, CSS, SASS, HTML 
- Node.js, Asp .Net Core, PHP, Rest API, GraphQL
